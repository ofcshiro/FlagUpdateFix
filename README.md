# FlagUpdateFix
Empty Vault Fix for the April Update Pacific Bank and Paleto Bank

Some Players have Issues with opening the Vault Door on the new Pacific Bank from Gabz
It opens, but the inside doesnt load / is empty.

This Script is fixing that issue by updating the Flag of the Vault Portal and setting it to 0

PolyZone is not required but highly recommended!

Installation is Simple:

Download the Script from the releases and drag and drop it into your resources folder.
go to your server.cfg and add 
* ensure FlagUpdateFix

if you use PolyZone ensure the FlagUpdateFix somewhere after PolyZone.
You have to enable PolyZone in the config if u want to use it instead of the distance check.
