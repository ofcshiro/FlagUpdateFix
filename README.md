# FlagUpdateFix
Empty Vault Fix for the April Update Pacific Bank and Paleto Bank

Some Players have Issues with opening the Vault Door on the new Pacific Bank from Gabz
It opens, but the inside doesnt load / is empty.

This Script is fixing that issue by updating the Flag of the Vault Portal and setting it to 0
For the Script to work you have to use PolyZone
